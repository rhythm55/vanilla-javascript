### What is JS
    Dynamic: 
      With Js a lot of dynamic behaviour in website inertaction got inroduced like - pop ups . Earlier website used to reload in the window. 
    Interpreted: 
      Js is a interpreted language. that means its converted into machine code then excuted. Generally in our browser following steps take place by inbuilt         browser js engine -
        1. source code is parsed in js engine
        2. its converted into machine code
        3. machine code is executed
    Lossely typed:
      In Js there is not strict typing - a variable type can change during run time . Say you have a variable x assinged with numeric value. Same varialbe in later code can be assinged as string. This is generally not possible in other languages like - java, c++ etc.
      Hosted language: 
        - Js can be run on browser, today most of the modern browser have JS engine in built like -
           - chrom v8
           - firefox SpiderMonkey
           in this case it do not have access to system variables etc. We get more visual interaction experience with it.
        - Js can also be run in system using node js
           after chrome v8 was launched it was converted as node js with which js can be executed in system.
